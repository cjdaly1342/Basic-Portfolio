				Hi there, my name is Christopher Daly.  I am attending Coding BootCamp at the University of Utah.  I am very excited to change	 my career and become a web developer.  I have been working as a Diesel Mechanic for the last 15 years, and as much as I love wrenching, it is very hard on my body which is resulting in two back surgery's.  So it will be nice to get off the shop floor and use my problem solving skills for building websites.
