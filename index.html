	<p>	Hi there, I am Christopher Daly.  I am currently learing how to code at the University of Utah Coding BootCamp.  I am looking forward to becoming a web developer, and have already found myself really enjoying learning this skill, both in class and on my own.  I have been working as a Diesel Mechanic for the past 15 years.  I got my start in that industry when I joined the US Marine Corps, where I worked on heavy equipment, and boats.  It was a good experience and I am grateful that I was able to learn a skill while being a part of the best armed forces service in the world, OOOOORAH!!
	</p>
	<p>	As for my educational background, I earned an Associates of Pre-Engineering at Salt Lake Community College, where I studied Mechanical Engineering.  I then transfered to the University of Utah to continue my studies in Mecahanical Engineering, and I am about 85% complete with a Bachelor's Degree.  I have been on a hiatus from school since 2015, due to a back injury I suffered while working as a Diesel Mechanic.
	</p>
	<p>	I am married to a wonderful woman, Elizabeth Daly, we have two children together, KaileeAnn who is 10, and Ariana who is 2.  KaileeAnn is my step-daughter, she is in to gymnastics, and cheer, and is very athletic, and a bit introverted, but sweet nonetheless.  Ariana is my 2 year old, she is my biological daughter, and my very favorite baby.  She is very outgoing, curious and very funny for a 2 year old.  She is the light of my life and can make my worst days into my best just spending time with her.</p>
